            This Policy applies to this software and the developer would not be held responsible for
            the content or privacy practices on any third party app not operated by the developer to
            which this software links or that links to this software,

        <h2>Permission and Access</h2>
        <p>
            Permissions and access are simply the device permissions the software requires to
            function and the access enabling this permission grants.
            To function efficiently and effectively as developed and designed,
            Fruit Radar will require some device permissions.
            The permissions are;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Camera</h3>
                The enablement of the camera permission grants the app access to your device camera
                to take pictures and videos.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Location</h3>
                When the location permission is enabled the software has access to your precise location
                (GPS and network-based).
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                Permission to access device storage allows the software read, modify or delete contents
                of your SD card.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Full Network Access</h3>
                Means the app is capable of creating network sockets and
                can use customized network protocols.
                This capability does not require the software to send data to the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Control Vibration</h3>
                This app can control your device vibrator.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The above permissions can be revoked at any time you desire,
            but revoking some of these permissions might cause the software to crash and some services
            of the software will cease to function.
            These permissions work hand-in-hand simultaneously to ensure smooth operations and
            utilization of the software.
            This is privy to only users with devices running Android 6.0 upwards.
        </p>

        <h2>Crash reports sending</h2>
        <p>
            Fruit Radar is stable and works fine but you may still experience few errors (bugs) and
            crashes, information about these crashes are important to me (the developer)
            so the issues can be fixed immediately and the software is running efficiently again.
            If you encounter a bug during the use of this software, please open an

            You can also access the project's repository directly from with the app to view
            and open new issues.
            You can report a debug log file if you gave EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions or
            use logcat to retrieve the log.
            If you gave permissions, you should be able to find it under
            eu.quelltext.mundraub.log.txt or eu.quelltext.mundraub.error.txt.
            The app (if starting) should point you to the file.
