        <h2>Permission and Access</h2>
        <p>
            Permissions and access are simply the device permissions the software requires to
            function and the access enabling this permission grants.
            To function efficiently and effectively as developed and designed,
            Fruit Radar will require some device permissions.
            The permissions are;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Camera</h3>
                The enablement of the camera permission grants the app access to your device camera
                to take pictures and videos.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Location</h3>
                When the location permission is enabled the software has access to your precise location
                (GPS and network-based).
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Storage</h3>
                Permission to access device storage allows the software read, modify or delete contents
                of your SD card.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Full Network Access</h3>
                Means the app is capable of creating network sockets and
                can use customized network protocols.
                This capability does not require the software to send data to the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Control Vibration</h3>
                This app can control your device vibrator.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The above permissions can be revoked at any time you desire,
            but revoking some of these permissions might cause the software to crash and some services
            of the software will cease to function.
            These permissions work hand-in-hand simultaneously to ensure smooth operations and
            utilization of the software.
            This is privy to only users with devices running Android 6.0 upwards.
        </p>

            crashes, information about these crashes are important to me (the developer)
